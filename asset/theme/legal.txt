Though A Fair-Bit Of The Themes I Use, Have Content Made By Me (Especially Mala & Mobi) -- 
Some Themes (ie: 'Material' & 'Ter10) Use Almost, If-Not Exclusively Images / Assets 
That I did Not Create And As-Such All-Rights-Are-Reserved By The Originators Of Said
Content, Besides What I Can Assume Are The Base Terms Which Allow For Personal-Use 
& Redistribution As-Per The Kind Of Content A Vast-Majority Of It Is; Wallpapers. 

I Will Slowly But Surely Try To Find What Can Best Be Assumed As 'The First Instance'
Of These Wallpapers On The Web And Provide Links To Them; With The Stated Terms Of Use.

Those Files In Question Are As-Followed;
